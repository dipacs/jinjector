JInjector
=========

JInjector is a very simple manual injector for Java and GWT applications.

# Creating the JInjector instance

First you need an instance of the injector. You can get one simply instantiating the JInjector class.

    JInjector myInjector = new JInjector();
    
# Registering instances
    
At some point when you application starts up you need to register your instances

    myInjector.register(MyServiceInterface.class, new MyServiceImpl());
    
This kind of registration creates a singleton registration. You always get back the same instance which you registered.

You can also register providers like this:

    myInjector.register(MyServiceInterface.class, new Provider<MyServiceInterface>() {
    
        public MyServiceInterface get() {
            if (someCondition) {
                return new MyServiceImpl1();
            } else {
                return new MyServiceImpl2();
            }
        }
    
    });
    
This kind of registration can be used when you want to return a new instance on every get call, or if you want to return different instances based on some conditions.

# Getting instances

After you registered all the services and instances you need, you can get back like this:

    MyServiceInterface service = myInjector.get(MyServiceInterface.class);
    
This returns the the registered instance of the MyServiceInterface class. Using the get method, the MyServiceInterface class must be already registered.

You can also get providers like this:

    Provider<MyServiceInterface> serviceProvider = myInjector.getProvider(MyServiceInterface.class);
    
This method does not require the MyServiceInterface to be registered. You can register the MyServiceInterface bind later. You can get the instance from the provider using the get() method:

    MyServiceInterface service = serviceProvider.get();
    
At this point, the MySrviceInterface bind must be registered.
